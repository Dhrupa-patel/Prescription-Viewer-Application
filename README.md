# Prescription-Viewer-Application
An Website + Andriod application was build to eliminate the use of paper for providing prescriptions.A website has been developed for entering the prescription details which is sent to the Prescription Viewer App present in the patient’s phone using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Database. Three people have access to the website – Admin, Doctor and Receptionist. They can access the website by logging in using their respective username and password.

-	The admin controls the website. New Doctor Accounts and Receptionist accounts are created by the admin. 
-	The receptionist enters the details of the patients into the website when the patients visit the hospital for the first time. A patient is registered under a particular doctor. 
-	The doctor can view the details of his patients. The doctor enters the prescription details into the website and it is sent to the patient’s phone.

Then patient enter its patient id in Prescription Viewer Android app on which prescription provided by doctor is retrieved from firebase database.
